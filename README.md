# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
import numpy as np

### Step 2: 
We have created a matrix using array and we will find inverse of this.

### Step 3: 
We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.

### Step 4: 
Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.

## Program:
Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

import numpy as np

A=np.array([[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]])

inverse=np.linalg.inv(A)

print(inverse)

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
